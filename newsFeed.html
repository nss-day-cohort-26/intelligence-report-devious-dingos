                    <p>Macklin and Snakehole were believed to be behind the constant temperature fluxuation in certain rooms at Nashville Software School. Snakehole and Macklin were thought to have hacked the Nest systems used by NSS. It was later proven that Snakehole and Macklin do not posses the intelligence and persistence to hack the system. There is no ongoing investigation and the cause of the temperature fluxuation is likey attributed to a lack of consensus between students, other students, and instructors.</p>
